# Belorder Rock Paper Scissors Webapp

This project provides a small multiplayer Rock Paper Scissors game for Belorder employees to have fun with colleagues. One person creates a session and shares the link so everyone can pick a choice and see the live results.

Your name is stored in your browser so you don't need to type it every time you join a session.

## Running

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
